              I like good scents – from Replica vibes to heavier, darker

              Cooking is one of the few things where I can’t doomscroll at

              I use games as a way to switch off my “operator brain” for a
              bit. No productivity hack, just play – but with time limits
              and some awareness so it doesn’t bleed into study time.

              The same logic that goes into FocusLimit goes into how I think

              put rails around it.
